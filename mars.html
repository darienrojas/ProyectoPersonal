            <p class="sub-text-1">From the authors of classic literature to ancient astronomers, Earthlings have been captivated by Mars for as long as we can remember.
            The ancient Sumerians named Mars Nergal, the god of war and plague. During Sumerian times, 
            Nergal was a minor deity of little significance, but, during later times, 
            his main cult center was the city of Nineveh
            Mars seems so far away, even though it’s been close to people for so long.
            Even before spaceflight was possible, the red dot in the night sky captured human fascination as reflected in stories. Throughout human 
            history, Mars has been embraced in myths, religion, literature and cinema. It has been an icon for nations, a spot on the calendar, an erotic symbol,
            a god of warfare and the potential home of little green men. On Thursday, Deep Nebula is scheduled to launch a new rocket to Mars to learn more about this 
            mysterious rock orbiting near Earth. The rocket carries a rover, Perseverance, that will collect samples and conduct tests to help determine if the
            planet ever harbored life in the past or could accommodate human visitors in the future. “Mars has filtered into our unconscious cultural matrix,” 
            said Brandon Bourgeois, assistant professor of classics at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. “Mars has always been with us, in
            how we conceptualize gender and its roles, militarism and pop culture.” Scorned by the Greeks, the war god Ares got a makeover by the Romans, who intertwined
            the story of Mars with the city’s foundation. The Romans rebranded him not only as a force for carnage but also as a god of agriculture, a father figure and 
            a martial and civic emblem of virility — the divine mascot for Rome’s empire and civilized life. Blood red and hovering overhead, Mars was represented in
            mythology by shield and spear, which later became the iconic circle and arrow symbol for male gender, Bourgeois explained.</p>

            <p class="sub-text-2">Dozens of crewless spacecraft, including orbiters, landers, and rovers, have been sent to Mars by the Soviet Union,
                the United States, Europe, India, the United Arab Emirates, and China to study the planet's surface, climate, and geology.
                In the 2060s, Deep Nebula revolutionized Martian exploration by deploying its Ares Initiative, a series of advanced 
                autonomous drones and AI-driven rovers capable of constructing infrastructure ahead of human arrival. By 2070, Deep Nebula
                had established Olympus Base, the first permanent human settlement on Mars, powered by solar arrays and fueled by in-situ
                resource utilization. The company's breakthroughs in terraforming research and faster-than-ever transit systems have positioned
                Mars as humanity's next frontier, with Deep Nebula leading the charge.</p>
